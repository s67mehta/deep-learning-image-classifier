# deep-learning-image-classifier

Key points:
- This app processes images of sports balls and classifies the related sport; built for individuals that are new to sports of a new country
- cleaned and pre-processed dataset of images before splitting into test set and train set
- Used transfer learning on a CNN (convolutional neural network) trained on ResNet34 for time efficiencies
- predicts the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy
